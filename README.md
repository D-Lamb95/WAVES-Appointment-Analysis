# WAVES Visitor Appointment Analysis

## Overview  
This project analyzes appointment activity from the WAVES Visitor Management System to uncover trends in visitor volume, monthly patterns, and weekday behavior. The goal is to help identify high-traffic periods, support resource planning, and provide leadership with clear, visual insights into operational demand.

The analysis uses Python (Pandas and Matplotlib) to clean the dataset, calculate frequency patterns, and generate visualizations that highlight when and how appointments occur throughout the year.

---

## Data Description  
The dataset includes the following fields:

- **Date** – appointment date  
- **Month** – extracted from the date  
- **Weekday** – day of the week for each appointment  
- **Appointment Count** – number of appointments recorded for each date  

Additional engineered fields include:

- **Month Name**  
- **Day of Week Name**  
- **Aggregated appointment totals by month**  
- **Aggregated appointment totals by weekday**

---

## Methods  

### 1. Data Cleaning  
- Converted the date column to datetime format  
- Extracted month and weekday names  
- Grouped data to compute totals by month and weekday  
- Ensured no missing or invalid values were present  

### 2. Visualizations  
The analysis produces several visuals:

- **Monthly Appointment Volume Bar Chart**  
- **Weekday Appointment Bar Chart**  
- **Line Plot Showing Appointment Trends Over Time**  
- **Optional stacked or grouped charts to compare categories**

These visualizations highlight seasonality, weekday traffic, and overall operational demand.

## Key Insights  

- Some months consistently show higher appointment volumes than others  
- Specific weekdays demonstrate clear spikes in visitor activity  
- Time-series trends reveal fluctuations that may be tied to operational patterns or external events  
- These insights support staffing, forecasting, and operational planning

## Requirements  

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use  

1. Open the Jupyter notebook included in this repository  
2. Load the WAVES appointment dataset  
3. Run the preprocessing steps to extract date-based features  
4. Generate visualizations to explore monthly and weekday trends  
5. Use insights for reporting, forecasting, and resource planning

## Future Improvements  

- Incorporate predictive modeling to forecast appointment trends  
- Build an interactive dashboard using Tableau, Power BI, or Streamlit  
- Add filtering by appointment type, location, or category  
- Introduce anomaly detection to flag unusually high or low traffic days
